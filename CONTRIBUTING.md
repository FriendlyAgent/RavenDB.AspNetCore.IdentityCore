# Contributing to RavenDB.AspNetCore.IdentityCore

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or later
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (for running RavenDB)

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FriendlyAgent/RavenDB.AspNetCore.IdentityCore.git
cd RavenDB.AspNetCore.IdentityCore
```

2. Start RavenDB:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

3. Build the solution:

```shell
dotnet build
```

4. Run the tests:

```shell
dotnet test
```

Tests require a running RavenDB instance at `http://localhost:8080`. Each test creates an isolated database that is automatically cleaned up.

## Branch Strategy
